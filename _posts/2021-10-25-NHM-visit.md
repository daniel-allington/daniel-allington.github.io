title: Natural History Museum online exhibit - Wildlife Photographer of the Year gallery
---

## Background
The Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition has been run by the Natural History Museum every year since 1964. By 2008, it was receiving 32000 entries per year. 
We looked at the online gallery, which contains prizewinning entries since 2010.

## Layout
At the top, there is an explanation of the exhibit (plus a list of filters, if they are being used). At the bottom is an online form where you can sign up to the 
Wildlife Photographer of the Year newsletter. The main part of the page is divided into rows with up to three photographs per row with no captions. However, each photograph
has copyright information including the creator's name in the top right or bottom left corners. If you click on a photograph, it opens a dedicated page for that image with an enlarged version
of the image itself, plus information about the image and the creator, and links to other images in the gallery by the same creator.

## User experience
It's easy to change your filters at any time because the filter tab moves up and down with you as you scroll through the photographs
